	  <p class="lead mb-5">I am a physical oceanographer with expertise in the dynamics of coastal, sub- and mesoscale ocean variability from Equatorial to Polar regions (e.g., Santana et al.,<a href="10.1007/s12237-017-0329-8">2018</a>, <a href="10.2112/jcoastres-d-17-00044.1">2019</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89222-3">2021</a>). My focus is to improve our understanding of ocean variability observations, numerical modelling, and data assimilation (EnOI and 4D-Var) (e.g., Santana et al.,<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10236-019-01307-w">2020</a> and <a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/16/3675/2023/">2023</a>). I work at the <a href="https://niwa.co.nz">National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)</a>, most specifically within the Coastal and Estuarine Group. At NIWA, my research targets at understanding past and future ocean conditions to increase society's resilience to extreme weather events. An example of my work is shown in the video below, where waves generated by a large storm hit the southeast coast of Aotearoa New Zealand. The waves were simulated using <a href="https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3">Wave Watch 3</a> forced by NIWA's atmospheric forecasting models</a>.

          <p class="mb-2"></p> <b> A year in the life of the East Auckland Current (EAuC)</b> 
          <p class="mb-0"></p>In 2022, I graduated as a PhD in Marine Science and Mathematics at the <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/marinescience"> University of Otago</a> in conjunction with the <a href="https://niwa.co.nz">National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA)</a>. My PhD focuses on understanding drivers of variability in the East Auckland Current (EAuC) and its impact on the shelf-slope connectivity and carbon export. The first chapter of my thesis is summarised in the article "Mesoscale and wind‑driven intra‑annual variability in the East Auckland Current" freely available at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89222-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89222-3</a> . It tells about a year in the life of the EAuC. There, we study mesoscale eddies (ocean cylinders of aprox. 100 km diameter) that dominated the circulation for a total of 260 days and the EAuC which was present for 110 days. Winds played an import role by generating variability shorter than 30 days in the velocity and temperature. </p>

          <p class="mb-2"></p> <b> Modelling the East Auckland Current </b>
          <p class="mb-0"></p>Surface and localised in situ observations are not enough to understand the full dynamics in the region. That's why we use numerical models that can provide daily 3D pictures of the oceans. In the figure below, we compare results from a model and observations from satellites and moored instruments. We can see that the model does a good job simulating the temperature structure. However, mesoscale eddy variability is not well represented. </p>

          <p class="mb-2"></p> <b> Data assimilation is needed </b>
          <p class="mb-0"></p> Mesoscale eddies are generated by instabilities which are unpredictable. Therefore, we need to incorporate satellite-derived and in situ data into the model to constrain its solution closer to observed values. This process is called data assimilation and aims to solve the equation below, which considers both model error and representativeness errors present in the observations (combined into <b>K</b>).</p>

          <p class="mb-2"></p> <b> Data Assimilation in the East Auckland Current </b>
	  <p class="mb-0"></p>Remotely-sensed and in situ observations were assimilated into the model (ROMS) using 4D-VAR. Sea surface height (SSH) and temperature (SST) and mooring temperature, salinity, velocity from stations M3, M4, and M5 were assimilated. The setup and validation of these and other experiments are shown in <a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/16/3675/2023/">Santana et al., (2023) </a>. The video below shows that the simulation on the right (ASFUVTS-h or ASFUVTS-2days in Santana et al., 2023) better represents the mesoscale eddies in comparison to the freely evolving simulation on the left (Control-JRA55do). </p>

          <p class="mb-2"></p> <b> Eddy driven cross-shelf in the East Auckland Current system</b>
	  <p class="mb-0"></p>Cross-shelf flows are ten times smaller than along shelf currents. Processes that promote cross-shelf exchange play an important role in renovation shelf waters and exporting material to the deep ocean. Here we used an eddy tracking algorithm to track eddies formed on the continental shelf (coastal eddies) to see their impact on generating cross-shelf exchange. We see that some eddies travel offshore while trapping river tracers (example: organic carbon) and may deposit in the deep ocean (video below). </p>

These eddies might also play an important role in cooling down the shelf break during marine heat events, especially for expected future warmer climates.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">I started to study polar regions as a research fellow at <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/department-of-physics.html/">The University of Auckland</a>, where I worked on the Scale-Aware Sea Ice Project <a href="https://sasip-climate.github.io/">(SASIP)</a>. I targeted at understanding ocean-ice interactions around Antarctica using the sea-ice model <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/10/1055/2016/">neXtSIM</a>. An example of neXtSIM's application is shown in the video below (credit: <a href="https://www.nersc.no/">Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center</a>).</p>

          <p class="mb-0"></p></p>
          <p class="mb-2"></p> <b> Antarctic neXtSIM  </b>
          <p class="mb-0"></p>My collaborators and I have implemented an Antartic version of neXtSIM which has been thoroughly validated (Santana et al., in prep.). We compare two versions of neXtSIM in this study using a modified Viscous-Elastic-Plastic (mEVP - used in climate models) and a Brittle Bigham-Maxwell rheology (science of material deformation). In the the mEVP run, sea ice moves slowly and fails to represent observed mesoscale drift features (video below). The BBM run improves the representation of sea ice ice at any given day compared to the mEVP rheology, and is able to reproduce cyclonic features in sea ice drift forced by atmospheric events. This happens because the BBM run reproduces ice fractures more realistically (previous video) which facilitates the transport of sea ice.</p>

          <p class="mb-2"></p> <i></i>

          <p class="mb-0"></p>These cyclones also break sea ice more effectively in the brittle model (BBM run) which generates more leads (linear fractures in sea ice). During winter, more sea ice tends to form in the BBM run compared to the mEVP run (video below). During the melting season, these leads might generate faster melting as broken ice / smaller parcels of ice tend to melt fast compared to larger parcels. This might be better reproduced in coupled ice-ocean models which is the focus of future research.</p>
